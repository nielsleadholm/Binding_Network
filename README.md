# PolyNetwork_Simulations

C++ code for creating and simulating polychronous neural networks. 

This code is based on the SPIKE! (https://github.com/OFTNAI/Spike) simulator for spiking neural networks. 

For an introduction to polychronous neural networks, see the paper "Polychronization: Computation With Spikes", Izhikevich, 2006 (https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spnet.htm)

For an introduction to the theory whereby polychronous neural networks might encode binding information, see the paper "The Emergence of Polychronization and Feature Binding in a Spiking Neural Network Model of the Primate Ventral Visual System", Eguchi, 2018 (http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2018-25960-001.html)
